## DESIGN CHOICES (UI)

### Colors
(colour palette)
 
- The natural color palette links to the theme of plants and plant care. 
- The headings, icons and body text are darker to ensure clear contrast and readability for the user across the site.
- The green header and footer ensures clear contrast and delineation between sections.
- Due to the lighthouse score for accessibility, the background color for the header and footer was adjusted:

### Typography
(font pairing)

- The font combination was chosen using guidance article from Mai Knoblovits [here](https://artisanthemes.io/great-google-font-combinations-ready-use/).
- The logo and headings use Amatic SC with a fallback of cursive and the body text uses Roboto Condensed with a fallback of san-serif.
- The choice of fonts were selected and installed using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Images/Icons
(choices of imagery)

- The icons were chosen to provide clear understanding of each plant and its care requirements.
- Each summary card has the same information structure with all icons standard throughout the site.

### Animations
- The navbar, social icons and buttons across the site have a subtle grow effect when hovered over by the user.
- All links have a color change and underlined effect when hovered for clear distinction from the body text.

### Responsiveness
- The website was designed mobile-first using flexbox to ensure responsiveness throughout the website.
- The standard grid from Bootstrap was used to achieve this.

## FEATURES/STRUCTURE

### Navigation
- The users will have a choice of home, login/logout & register when visiting the site. 
- There is a subtle hover state on each of the navigation items for better user experience.
- For mobile devices, the navigation toggles to a hamburger menu.

### Register 
- The user will be able to easily sign up as a user using the below form.
- If users are already registered, there is a link to easily navigate to login instead

### Login/Logout 
- The users can easily sign in using the below form with an option to 'remember me' if desired.
- If a user hasn't registered, there is a link to easily navigate to sign up instead.

### Footer
- The footer links directly to the social media pages of the plant care blog.
- There is a subtle hover state on each icon for better user experience.

### Error 400/404/403/500
- There are error pages in place in case a user is taken to a restricted area or the page doesn't exist.
- The return home button will take the user back to the plant list page.

### Features for Future Development
- It will become less efficient for the user to scroll through many posts in the list view so a search bar will allow users to find specific plants they want to read more about.
- It would increase user experience to add a method to 'save' blog posts so users can keep their favourite plants in one place.
- To increase user interactivity from readers, users could rate blog posts on how helpful the information was and give feedback.
- Pending comments can be added so users are aware they are awaiting approval.

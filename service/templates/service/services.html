                It can be very stressful leaving your furries when they're not 100% and we understand your concern.
                For cats with ongoing conditions, we're happy to ensure their medication is administered as required.
                Make sure to add this special request (and any tips for successful ingestion, we know tablets can be tricky!) when making a booking.
                For cats that have more acute care needs, we'll need to review on a case by case basis whether we can assist.
